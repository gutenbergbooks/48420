  <h2 class='c001'>THREE LITTLE KITTENS</h2>
<p class='drop-capa0_3_0_6 c009'>Jazbury came scampering gaily up the
stairs to where his mother and Aunt
Tabby were sitting on the window-sill
washing their faces and cleaning their fur.</p>

<p class='c010'>Jazbury was a small black kitten with white
markings on his face and breast, and soft little
white paws. Soft as those little paws were there
were sharp, needle claws hidden in their velvet,
and Jazbury knew how to use them when necessary,
too.</p>

<p class='c010'>Mother Bunch's tail hung down from the window-seat,
waving softly. It looked almost like a
mouse, so soft and grey. Jazbury made a jump,
and caught it with his claws. His mother
growled and drew her tail up and curled it
around her.</p>

<p class='c010'>Jazbury jumped up after it, and tried to tease
his mother into playing with him.</p>

<p class='c010'>"Jazbury, you haven't washed yourself this
morning," said his aunt severely. "Look at
your paws. You've been in the coal-bin again,
you naughty kitten."</p>

<p class='c010'>"Well, I thought I heard a mouse there,"
mewed Jazbury.</p>

<p class='c010'>"A mouse! What would a mouse be doing
in the coal-bin? No, you just wanted an excuse
for clambering about among the coal and making
it rattle. And now look how dirty you are."</p>

<p class='c010'>"Sit down and make yourself clean, Jazbury,"
said his mother. "No; let my tail alone. I'm
not going to play with you. And if you want
any breakfast you'd better make haste to wash
yourself. I will <i>not</i> have such a dirty kitten
eating from the saucer with me."</p>

<p class='c010'>Jazbury sat down and began to wash his face
with one of his grimy little paws.</p>

<p class='c010'>His aunt sighed. "Paws first," she said.
"You'll only make yourself dirtier if you try to
wash your face before you clean your paws."</p>

<p class='c010'>"Oh, dear me!" mewed Jazbury crossly.</p>

<p class='c010'>"I really don't know what's going to become
of you if you don't keep yourself cleaner," his
aunt went on. "I'm really afraid something
terrible may happen to you. I knew a cat once
who wouldn't wash herself, and so her mistress
used to do it for her with <i>water</i>, so she was wet
all over. Water and soap! And a sponge!
How would you feel if that happened to you
some day? And it may unless you learn to keep
yourself cleaner."</p>

<p class='c010'>Jazbury was frightened at the thought that
such a thing might happen to him, too, if he
didn't keep himself clean, and he set about washing
himself in earnest. First he washed his
paws, and after he had cleaned them he cleaned
his face, licking his paw with his little pink
tongue, and curling it round over his furry little
cheeks and forehead and chin and even behind
his ears. By breakfast time he was clean
enough to be allowed to eat with his mother and
Aunt Tabby.</p>

<p class='c010'>The human people and the cat people had
their breakfast at the same time. The human
people had theirs in the dining-room, and the
cat people had theirs in the pantry. The cat
people always had very good meals; bread and
milk, and fish twice a week, and sometimes meat
and potatoes.</p>

<p class='c010'>"What's the use of my bothering to catch
mice?" Jazbury often said. "I get all I want to
eat anyway."</p>

<p class='c010'>And his aunt would answer, "You ought to
feel grateful enough for your good meals to
<i>want</i> to catch mice for people."</p>

<p class='c010'>But Jazbury paid little attention to such advice.
All he cared for was having a good time
and play about, and if mice had to be caught he
left it to his mother and Aunt Tabby to do it.</p>

<div class='chapter'></div>
  <h2 class='c001'>II</h2>
<p class='drop-capa0_3_0_6 c009'>Jazbury's best friend was a little white
kitten named Fluffy. Fluffy lived in the
house next door to Jazbury's.</p>

<p class='c010'>At the other side of Jazbury's house was an
open lot. The gentlemen cats of the neighbourhood
had a club that met in this lot every
night. It was a singing club, but sometimes the
cats quarrelled among themselves, and were
very noisy. Mother Bunch and Aunt Tabby
said they wished the cats would meet some other
place; but Jazbury liked to hear them. He
wished he were old enough to belong to the
club, and sing and fight, and stay out all night
the way they did. But he was still only a soft,
playful little kitten, who had not even caught
his first mouse as yet.</p>

<p class='c010'>Once Jazbury had climbed up on the fence,
and jumped over into the lot. There he had
prowled about among the weeds, and chased
grasshoppers, and shiny black crickets. It was
great fun.</p>

<p class='c010'>Another kitten was hunting there, too, but he
was hunting birds. He laughed at Jazbury for
catching grasshoppers. He told Jazbury his
name was Yowler, and that he belonged to the
baker who lived further down the street. Yowler
had a broad, ugly face and a stubby tail, and
his fur looked dirty and uncared for. He was
a yellow cat.</p>

<p class='c010'>Jazbury liked him because he was strong and
big and bold, but when Jazbury told his mother
about Yowler she said she did not want Jazbury
to play with him. She said she knew all about
him; that he was a very coarse, noisy cat, and she
told Jazbury he must not go over in the lot again.</p>

<p class='c010'>Jazbury was allowed to go over into Fluffy's
yard whenever he wanted to. Mother Bunch
and Aunt Tabby both liked Fluffy. They
thought he was a very nice, well-behaved little
kitten.</p>

<p class='c010'>One day when Jazbury climbed up on the
fence that separated his yard from Fluffy's he
saw his little friend sitting down on the kitchen
steps, watching something in the grass below
him. He was so intent on what he saw that he
did not notice Jazbury.</p>

<p class='c010'>"Hello, Fluffy!" mewed Jazbury.</p>

<p class='c010'>Fluffy jumped. Then he looked around.</p>

<p class='c010'>"Hello!"</p>

<p class='c010'>"What you got there?" asked Jazbury curiously.</p>

<p class='c010'>"A toad."</p>

<p class='c010'>"Going to catch it?"</p>

<p class='c010'>"No, I don't like them. They haven't any
fur, and I don't like the feel of them."</p>

<p class='c010'>"Well, come on up here. I want to show you
something."</p>

<p class='c010'>Fluffy climbed up a step-ladder that was leaning
against the fence.</p>

<p class='c010'>"What are you going to show me?"</p>

<p class='c010'>"Do you see this fence? Well, I walked all
the way round on the top of it yesterday, and
never fell off once."</p>

<p class='c010'>Fluffy looked at the fence in silence for a moment
or so. Then he said, "That's not so much
to do."</p>

<p class='c010'>"I guess it is, too. You couldn't do it."</p>

<p class='c010'>"Yes, I could, if I wanted to."</p>

<p class='c010'>"Well, let's see you."</p>

<p class='c010'>"I don't want to."</p>

<p class='c010'>"You're afraid."</p>

<p class='c010'>"No, I'm not, either."</p>

<p class='c010'>"Yes, you are, too."</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c011'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>"Fraidy cat! Fraidy cat!</div>
      <div class='line'>Never catch a mouse or rat."</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>"I <i>can</i>; I <i>can</i> catch mice. And I can walk on
the fence, too. I'll show you."</p>

<p class='c010'>"Walk to the post and back and I'll give you
a chicken bone I found down back of the rain-barrel."</p>

<p class='c010'>"All right; it's a promise. Now watch me."</p>

<p class='c010'>Fluffy set out along the top of the fence, walking
very slowly and carefully, one paw before
the other.</p>

<p class='c010'>"Hurry up! hurry up! No fair walking so
slowly," said Jazbury.</p>

<p class='c010'>"Yes, it is fair, too. And don't you mew at
me."</p>

<p class='c010'>Fluffy reached the post safely, and then tried
to turn. But that was not such an easy matter.
He lost his balance. His tail waved wildly.
His claws clutched the fence. He teetered back
and forth, and then, with a loud mew, he half
jumped, half fell, down on the flower bed below.</p>

<p class='c010'>Jazbury laughed and laughed, the way kittens
do. You wouldn't have known he was laughing.
You couldn't have heard it, but a cat or
kitten could. It hurt Fluffy's feelings to be
laughed at.</p>

<p class='c010'>"I don't care. I don't believe you could do
it, either," he mewed.</p>

<p class='c010'>"Now watch me!" said Jazbury.</p>

<p class='c010'>He ran gaily out along the fence top with
never a pause or mis-step. He ran all the way
down one side without stopping, and then
started across the back fence toward the other
side.</p>

<p class='c010'>Now back of Jazbury's yard was another yard,
and a very rough boy lived there. The boy was
out in the yard now. He was squirting a hose,
and another boy with a very dirty face was there
with him.</p>

<p class='c010'>"Hi!" cried the dirty-faced boy. "Look at
that kitten walking along the fence."</p>

<p class='c010'>"Yeh!" answered the other. "I'm going to
squirt the hose on him!"</p>

<p class='c010'>"Go ahead!" cried the other. "See what he'll
do."</p>

<p class='c010'>Jazbury was very much frightened. He began
to run. He might have jumped down off
the fence, but he never thought of that. He ran
as fast as he could, but before he could reach
the other side a torrent of cold water struck
him, almost sweeping him off the fence. The
boy was squirting the hose on him as he had
said.</p>

<p class='c010'>Jazbury tried to hold fast to the fence;
he tried to yowl, but the rush of water filled
his mouth--his eyes--his ears. Blinded and
drenched, he was finally carried off the fence
by it, and landed in the yard below--his own
yard, luckily. There the fence protected him.</p>

<p class='c010'>Fluffy looked on, horrified by what he saw.</p>

<p class='c010'>Jazbury struggled to his feet, and ran toward
the house, trailing water after him.</p>

<p class='c010'>"Mew, miew!" he cried. "Oh, Momma!
Momma! Come quick! Miew! Miew! Miew!"</p>

<p class='c010'>Mother Bunch heard him crying, and burst
open the screen door of the kitchen and came
running to meet him.</p>

<p class='c010'>"What is it? What is it?" she cried.
"What's the matter, Jazbury?"</p>

<p class='c010'>"Oh, I'm so wet. I'm so w-w-wet!" he shivered.</p>

<p class='c010'>"Oh, my child, come over here!" Mother
Bunch hurried him over to a warm, sunny corner
beside the kitchen steps, and began to dry
him with her pink, rough tongue.</p>

<p class='c010'>"But how did it happen?" she asked again.
"Did you fall into a bucket?"</p>

<p class='c010'>"I didn't fall into anything except the yard.
It was some boys and they put water on me,"
and Jazbury told his mother the whole story.</p>

<p class='c010'>Aunt Tabby sat by and listened gravely.
"Well, Jazbury, it's really no more than I expected,"
said she. "It's just as I told you. If
you won't wash yourself you'll get washed by
some one else. And I must say you're looking
cleaner than you've looked for many a day."</p>

<p class='c010'>His mother said nothing. She thought Jazbury
had been punished enough by the drenching
without being lectured as well.</p>
<div class='chapter'></div>
  <h2 class='c001'>III</h2>
<p class='drop-capa0_3_0_6 c009'>"Jazbury, I've found a fresh mouse-hole,"
said Aunt Tabby one day. "It's
in the cupboard under the sink, and the
cook has left the door open. Come with me and
I'll show it to you. I have great hopes the mouse
may come out before so very long, and if you sit
there and watch, you may catch him."</p>

<p class='c010'>"Aunt Tabby! Oh, I don't want to watch
mouse-holes today," mewed Jazbury. "I told
Fluffy I would come out and play with him.
Mayn't I, Mother? I said I would, and I don't
want to sit there in the cupboard and watch.
Maybe the mouse wouldn't come out anyway,
and Fluffy expects me."</p>

<p class='c010'>"You always have some excuse, Jazbury,"
said his aunt, severely. "If you had your way
you would never do anything but play. But as
long as you have to learn to mouse some time, I
don't see why today isn't as good a time to begin
as any."</p>

<p class='c010'>"Yes, Jazbury. Go with your aunt," said his
mother. "And don't look sulky. I'm sure you
ought to be very grateful to her for telling you
about the hole."</p>

<p class='c010'>"But I don't want to sit in the cupboard all
morning. And <i>I</i> can find holes, too. I found
one out in the shed yesterday. A big, big one.
I'd rather watch that one if I have to watch
any."</p>

<p class='c010'>"Very well," said his aunt. "You may do as
you please about it, but I think you'd be much
more likely to catch a mouse in the cupboard."</p>

<p class='c010'>"I'd rather watch in the shed."</p>

<p class='c010'>His mother, too, said he might do as he chose
about it, but neither she nor Aunt Tabby had
much hopes he would catch anything.</p>

<p class='c010'>"I'll have to go out and tell Fluffy I can't play
this morning," said Jazbury.</p>

<p class='c010'>"Don't be long," said his mother. "Come
straight back as soon as you have told him."</p>

<p class='c010'>Jazbury promised he would, and then he ran
out into the kitchen and mewed for the cook to
open the outside door for him.</p>

<p class='c010'>"Bother those cats!" scolded the cook. "It
takes all my time letting them in and out."</p>

<p class='c010'>She left the soup she was stirring and came
over and opened the door, and the kitten ran
past her out into the sunny yard.</p>

<p class='c010'>Fluffy was sitting on the top step of the ladder,
looking over the fence and waiting for him.</p>

<p class='c010'>"I can't come out to play with you now. I
have to catch a mouse for Mother and Aunt
Tabby."</p>

<p class='c010'>Fluffy was much interested. "Where are you
going to catch it?" he asked.</p>

<p class='c010'>"In the shed. I found the hole myself. It's
a big, <i>big</i>, <span class='fss'>BIG</span> hole. I guess the biggest mouse
you ever saw lives in it. I guess you'd be scared
if you tried to catch a mouse as big as that one;
wouldn't you?"</p>

<p class='c010'>"Maybe I would and maybe I wouldn't."</p>

<p class='c010'>"I know you would."</p>

<p class='c010'>"I've caught some big mice, too," said Fluffy.</p>

<p class='c010'>"Not as big as this one, though. I'll show
him to you after I catch him."</p>

<p class='c010'>Jazbury ran back and mewed for the cook to
open the door again. The cook was so angry
she would not open it for quite a while, but Jazbury
mewed so loudly that at last she was
obliged to for the sake of peace. When she did
open it she cried, "Scat!" at him, and pushed out
her foot at him as he ran past her.</p>

<p class='c010'>Jazbury did not mind that. He hurried on
past her, and out into the shed, the door of which
was luckily open.</p>

<p class='c010'>The hole he had found was down back of a
bench, and some unused buckets were piled up
in front of it.</p>

<p class='c010'>Jazbury crouched down in the shadow of the
buckets. He crouched there for a long time
without moving, and with his eyes fixed patiently
on the hole. Aunt Tabby would have been
pleased and surprised if she could have seen
how still he kept.</p>

<p class='c010'>After a while, however, he began to feel discouraged.
He wondered whether there were
any mouse there after all. Maybe Aunt Tabby
was right, and he should have watched in the
cupboard.</p>

<p class='c010'>Just as he was thinking this he heard a scratching,
brushing sound inside the hole, and a grey
head with a pointed nose and two gleaming
round black eyes appeared at the mouth of the
hole.</p>

<p class='c010'>Jazbury quivered all over as he crouched still
lower and made ready to leap upon the mouse.
Then suddenly he stiffened and stared with big
eyes. Surely no mouse had ever had such a big
head as that. After the head followed a great
fat body, and a long, <i>long</i>, <span class='fss'>LONG</span> tail. The
mouse was not a mouse at all, but a huge grey
rat.</p>

<p class='c010'>Jazbury was terrified. His tail grew big and
every separate hair stood on end.</p>

<p class='c010'>The rat looked at him with a wicked grin.
"Ho, ho! So you thought you'd catch me, did
you?" cried the rat. "I knew you were there.
I heard you and I smelled you. You thought
you'd catch me, did you? Well, here I am!
Now let's see you catch me."</p>

<p class='c010'>The rat sidled over toward Jazbury, and just
as fast as he sidled over Jazbury backed away.
He tried to spit and growl, but he was too frightened.</p>

<div id='il020'  class='figcenter id006'>
<img src='images/il020fp.jpg' alt='' class='ig006' />
<div class='ic006'>
<p><i>The rat looked at him with a wicked grin</i></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>"Thought you'd catch me! Maybe I'll catch
you. I like little kittens for supper. Like 'em
as much as cheese."</p>

<p class='c010'>He gave a heavy jump toward Jazbury, and
his sharp teeth showed in a wicked grin.</p>

<p class='c010'>"Momma! Momma! Aunt Tabby! Come
quick," mewed Jazbury shrilly.</p>

<p class='c010'>Suddenly the rat started. His eyes glared
past Jazbury toward the kitchen door. A look
of terror came over his face. He wheeled about
and scuttled back toward his hole.</p>

<p class='c010'>At the same moment there was an angry
growl, and a grey shape shot past Jazbury. It
was Aunt Tabby. She had heard Jazbury's
cry of distress and had flown to help him. She
rushed at the rat and made a wild grab at him.
But he was too quick for her. Already he was
disappearing in his hole. She did catch his tail,
but it slipped away from her and the next moment
the rat was gone.</p>

<p class='c010'>Jazbury began to mew pitifully.</p>

<p class='c010'>"Why, Jazbury, what are you crying about
now? You're all safe," said his aunt.</p>

<p class='c010'>"Mew! mew! mew! Oh, he frightened me
so! I never knew there were mouses like that!"</p>

<p class='c010'>"Mouse! That wasn't a mouse, kitten!
That was a rat, and a very big and savage rat,
too. No wonder you were frightened. You'll
have to be a bigger kitten before you can grapple
with a rat. I've been trying to have a chance
at him myself, but I've never even seen him
till today. He always stays hidden when I'm
around."</p>

<p class='c010'>Aunt Tabby talked on, comforting the kitten
until at last he stopped trembling and his hairs
smoothed themselves down into the usual
smoothness.</p>

<p class='c010'>"Now, Jazbury, perhaps you'll watch one of
my mouse-holes," she ended. "I promise you
nothing but mice ever come out of it."</p>

<p class='c010'>"Very well. And thank you, Aunt Tabby,"
said Jazbury meekly. And he followed her
back from the shed into the kitchen, wondering
what he would say to Fluffy when he saw him
again, and how he could explain not having
caught anything after all.</p>

<p class='c010'>However, he need not have been troubled.
Fluffy was such a gentle little kitten that he
never would tease or make fun of any one, no
matter what they did or didn't do.</p>

<div class='chapter'></div>
  <h2 class='c001'>IV</h2>
<p class='drop-capa0_1_0_6 c009'>The next morning Aunt Tabby again
offered to show Jazbury the mouse-hole
in the cupboard.</p>

<p class='c010'>Jazbury looked very sulky. He was ashamed
to try to beg off again, particularly after what
Aunt Tabby had done for him the day before,
but it seemed hard to have to give up another
morning of play.</p>

<p class='c010'>He followed Aunt Tabby into the kitchen.
The cook had gone to market and the door of the
cupboard was ajar. Aunt Tabby pushed it open
and led the way into the darkness where the pots
and pans were stored.</p>

<p class='c010'>"Here's the hole, Jazbury," she told him in
a low voice. "I have a feeling the mouse is out,
and if you only keep perfectly quiet I feel sure
it will try to get back into the hole again. That
will be your chance, and I shall be very much
disappointed if you do not catch your first mouse
this morning."</p>

<p class='c010'>"I don't feel as if I could catch anything today,"
said Jazbury sulkily.</p>

<p class='c010'>"Now, Jazbury, don't go about it that way.
If you don't catch it, it will be your own fault,
and I shall feel very much provoked with you."</p>

<p class='c010'>Then Aunt Tabby went away and left him
there. She did not go very far, however. She
was so anxious to have him get the mouse that
she lingered close by where she could hear everything
that went on in the cupboard--though this
the kitten did not know.</p>

<p class='c010'>Jazbury crouched down in the shadow of the
kettle as his aunt bade him, and kept perfectly
quiet with his eyes fixed on the hole. Not even
a whisker stirred. He <i>did</i> wish he could catch
that mouse, if only to show Aunt Tabby what he
could do if he chose. How pleased and surprised
she and his mother would be if he were
really to get one. Outside the kitchen was very
still. The clock tick-tocked and the kettle simmered
on the stove.</p>

<p class='c010'>Suddenly Jazbury heard a little scratching,
scraping sound back of one of the pots. It was
so very little and faint that only a cat's ears could
have heard it. Jazbury's eyes grew round, and
his muscles stiffened ready for a leap.</p>

<p class='c010'>Suddenly out from behind the pot whined a
winged grasshopper. It flew so close to Jazbury
it almost brushed his nose.</p>

<p class='c010'>Forgetting all about the mouse, Jazbury made
a leap for it. He knocked against a tin pan
that clattered down with a tremendous din. At
the same moment a little grey shape flitted out
from behind him like a tiny shadow, slipped
across the floor and disappeared down the
mouse-hole. It was the mouse, and Jazbury had
lost it.</p>

<div id='il026'  class='figcenter id007'>
<img src='images/il026fp.jpg' alt='' class='ig007' />
<div class='ic007'>
<p><i>He knocked against a tin pan that clattered<br />down with a tremendous din</i></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Almost at the same moment Jazbury received
a sharp box on the ear that almost upset him.</p>

<p class='c010'>"You <i>bad</i> boy!" cried his aunt. "I'm just all
out of patience with you. Even when a mouse runs
right by under your nose you can't catch it."</p>

<p class='c010'>Jazbury began to mew. "Well, you don't
have to box my ears, anyway. I couldn't help
it."</p>

<p class='c010'>"Yes, you could. That's what provokes me
so. Fluffy's not half as quick and active as you,
and look at the way he catches mice. I'm
ashamed of you."</p>

<hr class='c012' />

<p class='c010'>Mother Bunch's round furry face appeared at
the door looking in at them. "What's the matter?
Has Jazbury been doing anything?"</p>

<p class='c010'>"No, he <i>hasn't</i> been doing it, that's the matter,"
and Aunt Tabby poured out the whole
story, while Jazbury stood by looking both sullen
and ashamed.</p>

<p class='c010'>"I don't care; I couldn't help it," he said.</p>

<p class='c010'>"Don't say 'don't care' to me," said Mother
Bunch. "It isn't respectful--not to me, nor to
your aunt either. The mouse has gone, I suppose,
so there's no use in your staying here.
You may go out on the kitchen steps. But you
mustn't play around or go over to see Fluffy.
That is your punishment for being so careless,
and disrespectful, too."</p>

<div class='chapter'></div>
  <h2 class='c001'>V</h2>
<p class='drop-capa0_3_0_6 c009'>Jazbury sat out on the kitchen steps
and sulked. He did not think Aunt
Tabby had any right to box his ears.
And instead of being sorry for him his mother
had scolded him. It wasn't fair. He was always
getting scolded and punished. Well, he'd
just run away. That's what he'd do. He'd run
away and never come back. Then they'd be
sorry. Maybe they'd cry. He just wished they
would. He'd be glad if they cried.</p>

<p class='c010'>Suddenly Fluffy's little furry white face
peered over the fence. "Hello, Jazbury."</p>

<p class='c010'>Jazbury did not answer at once. Then he
said, "'Lo!"</p>

<p class='c010'>"What's the matter?"</p>

<p class='c010'>"Nothing the matter."</p>

<p class='c010'>"What you looking so cross about?"</p>

<p class='c010'>"Nothing; ain't looking cross."</p>

<p class='c010'>Fluffy climbed over the fence and came and
sat down by Jazbury. He looked at him once
or twice, but he did not say anything. He was
rather afraid of Jazbury when Jazbury was in
one of his tempers.</p>

<p class='c010'>"Can't you come over in my yard to play?"
he asked at last.</p>

<p class='c010'>"Don't want to."</p>

<p class='c010'>At this moment there was a scratching sound
on the fence between the yard and the lot, and a
third kitten, a large yellow one, scrambled to the
top of one of the fence posts and seated himself
on it. It was Yowler.</p>

<p class='c010'>"Hello, Jaz!" he called down, in the yowling
voice that had given him his name.</p>

<p class='c010'>"Hello!" answered Jazbury, still very sulky.</p>

<p class='c010'>The newcomer took no notice of Fluffy.</p>

<p class='c010'>"I got sumpin' to tell you."</p>

<p class='c010'>"What?"</p>

<p class='c010'>"Can't tell you here. Come on over in the lot
and I'll tell you."</p>

<p class='c010'>"Can't."</p>

<p class='c010'>"Why not?"</p>

<p class='c010'>"'Cause!"</p>

<p class='c010'>"Oh, come on!"</p>

<p class='c010'>"I tell you I can't. I got to sit here for
awhile."</p>

<p class='c010'>"Why?"</p>

<p class='c010'>"<i>Because</i>, I tell you."</p>

<p class='c010'>Yowler jumped down into the yard and came
over and seated himself beside Jazbury. Fluffy
drew away. The newcomer was very dirty.</p>

<p class='c010'>"You gwan home, kit," said Yowler to Fluffy.
"Me and Jaz want to talk."</p>

<p class='c010'>"I shan't go home unless I want to," answered
Fluffy, bristling up. "I don't have to go; do I,
Jazbury?"</p>

<p class='c010'>"No. If you have anything to say, Yowler,
say it."</p>

<p class='c010'>"I'm afraid this kit'll tell."</p>

<p class='c010'>"Oh, go ahead!" cried Jazbury impatiently.
"He won't tell; will you, Fluffy?"</p>

<p class='c010'>"Of course not."</p>

<p class='c010'>"Well--" Yowler paused and looked carefully
round to see that no one was listening.
"I'm going to run away."</p>

<p class='c010'>Jazbury started violently. "Run away!"
How strange for Yowler to say that. It was exactly
the thing he had been thinking about.</p>

<p class='c010'>"Yeh! Run away. I'm tired of sticking
around in the baker's shop and catching his
mice for him. Let him catch his own mice if
he wants 'em. I'm tired of it, I tell you."</p>

<p class='c010'>"Where are you going to run to?"</p>

<p class='c010'>"Somewhere. I think maybe I'll go and live
in the woods for awhile. Want to come along?
It's going to be fine."</p>

<p class='c010'>"The woods!" broke in Fluffy. "You
couldn't live there. You'd be rained on.
You'd get <i>wet</i>."</p>

<p class='c010'>"Oh, you keep quiet," mewed Yowler
roughly. "I ain't talking to you. Don't you
want to come, Jaz? There's lots of places to
live,--hollow trees and things; and birds, and
field mice, and fish; we'd just have a great
time."</p>

<p class='c010'>"But you don't know how to get there," said
Jazbury.</p>

<p class='c010'>"Sure I do. Some man brought me in from
the country when I was a kitten; a <i>little</i> kitten,
I mean; we came past a wood, and I could find
my way back there just as easy as not if I tried.
Come on, Jaz. It's going to be fine, I tell you."</p>

<p class='c010'>"I'd just as lief as not," said Jazbury slowly.
"When are you going?"</p>

<p class='c010'>"Tomorrow morning, I guess; just as soon as
the baker opens his shop and I can get you."</p>

<p class='c010'>"You come, too, Fluffy," cried Jazbury suddenly.
"I'll go if you will."</p>

<p class='c010'>"Oh, no!" mewed Fluffy, and Yowler chimed
in, "Oh, he can't go. He's too much of a mamma's
pet. We don't want him."</p>

<p class='c010'>"Yes, we do, too. And I won't go unless he
will. Come on, Fluffy. We'll have lots of fun.
And we needn't stay unless we want to. Come
on!"</p>

<p class='c010'>It took a great deal of persuasion before
Fluffy would agree to the plan, but at last he said
he would go if Yowler would promise to let him
come home any time he wanted to. He also
made Yowler promise that they would come
straight back again that very day if they could
not find a cave or a hollow tree for shelter before
nightfall.</p>

<div id='il034'  class='figcenter id008'>
<img src='images/il034fp.jpg' alt='' class='ig008' />
<div class='ic008'>
<p><i>He dreamed he was trying to run down a road toward a wood<br />and a dog was after him--two dogs</i></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>It was arranged that they should all three
meet in the lot the next morning as soon after
breakfast as possible. Yowler wanted them to
start before breakfast, but to this Fluffy would
not consent. Jazbury, too, thought it would be
well to have a last saucer of milk before they set
out. They would not be apt to find much milk
in the wood.</p>

<p class='c010'>That night Jazbury was very restless. He
was too excited to sleep well. When he did
doze off at last he dreamed he was trying to run
down a road toward a wood and a dog was after
him--two dogs--three dogs. He dug his nails
into the ground and tried to pull himself along,
but his paws seemed to have grown fast to the
ground. Then the first dog was upon him, had
caught him--was crying in his ear, "Jazbury,
Jazbury, wake up. You must be having a
nightmare, you are mewing so."</p>

<p class='c010'>He opened his eyes and there he was, safe in
the warm, snug home cellar, and Aunt Tabby
was patting him, and telling him to wake up.
Jazbury was still trembling and panting from
the terror of his dream.</p>

<p class='c010'>"What were you dreaming, dear?" asked his
mother.</p>

<p class='c010'>"Oh, nothing," said Jazbury. "Just something
about dogs"; and then he snuggled up
against his mother and went to sleep again, and
this time he slept quietly and undisturbed by
dreams.</p>

<div class='chapter'></div>
  <h2 class='c001'>VI</h2>
<p class='drop-capa0_3_0_4 c009'>When Jazbury awoke the next
morning the sun was shining in
through the cellar window, the
birds were singing, and the air was full of dewy
freshness. His ugly dreams of the night before
were all forgotten. There could not have been
a more wonderful day for three little kittens to
start out on their adventures.</p>

<p class='c010'>The three of them met in the lot soon after
breakfast, as they had agreed. Yowler at once
took command. "Now, kits," said he, "we
won't go all together in a bunch. That would
look queer, and some one would be sure to notice
us. I'll start off first; Fluff can come next,
and then Jaz. You keep about half a square
behind me, Fluffy, and Jaz about half a square
behind you. Then you can see which way I go,
but nobody will think we're together."</p>

<p class='c010'>To this plan the others agreed.</p>

<p class='c010'>"Suppose we meet some dogs?" said Fluffy.</p>

<p class='c010'>"If you do, you'll just have to do the best you
can. Run up an alley, or climb a fence or
something. Now come on! We'll go as far
as the edge of the lot together."</p>

<p class='c010'>The three little kittens stole away through the
weeds, and when they came to the edge of the
lot Jazbury and Fluffy stopped. They watched
Yowler cross to the other side of the street and
turn a corner. Then, after a moment or so,
Fluffy followed, then Jazbury.</p>

<p class='c010'>The others were still in sight when Jazbury
turned the corner, Yowler quite a distance up
the street, and Fluffy not so far.</p>

<p class='c010'>Two women with brooms in their hands were
sweeping their pavements and gossiping together
as they swept. "Look at that kitten,"
said one of them, as Jazbury ran past them.
"That's the third kitten that's gone by in the last
few minutes."</p>

<p class='c010'>"I know. I noticed that," replied the other.
"Funny! Wonder where they come from!"</p>

<p class='c010'>As Jazbury neared the next corner he heard a
sound of voices in loud talk, and then the bark
of a dog. Some boys were coming that way,
and a dog was with them. They were just
around the corner.</p>

<p class='c010'>Luckily there was an alleyway close by. Jazbury
ran into it and crouched there, and a moment
later a group of rough-looking boys passed
by it, with a couple of dogs at their heels.
Luckily none of them thought of looking into
the alleyway. Jazbury waited till the sound of
voices had died away, and then he came out and
ran on again. Yowler and Fluffy were far
ahead now, and he had to hurry to get near them
again.</p>

<p class='c010'>A little later Fluffy had an adventure that
might have been very serious. He was going
past a little brown wooden house when the door
opened, and a little girl came out, followed by
an ugly-looking cur. Almost at once the dog
saw Fluffy. He gave a sort of half yelp, half
bark, and started after him. Fluffy saw him
coming. There was no fence, and no alleyway
where he could take shelter. Fortunately there
was a tree a little further down the street, and it
was toward this tree that Fluffy ran for his life,
his tail big, and every hair on end.</p>

<p class='c010'>The dog was close at his heels when he dashed
up the tree. He clung there, part way up, the
dog leaping and yelping below him. Jazbury
watched from behind a flight of steps, trembling
and terrified. It seemed as though any moment
the dog's teeth might close on the kitten. Fluffy
clung there, afraid to try to climb higher, lest he
lose his hold, and fall back into the dog's jaws.</p>

<div class='ic009'>
<p><i>It seemed as though any moment the dog's teeth might<br />close on the kitten</i></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>The little girl had been shouting at the dog,
and now she found a stick, and running up she
beat him until he whined and ran a little distance
away. He did not go far, however, but
stood watching eagerly while the little girl tried
to coax Fluffy to come down to her. But this
Fluffy would not do. He had now scrambled
up to a crotch of the tree, and sat there mewing.</p>

<p class='c010'>Presently the door of the house opened, and a
woman looked out. "Pansy," she called to the
child, "you go on and get me the yeast cake.
I'm waiting for it."</p>

<p class='c010'>"But, mother, there's a kitten up this tree."</p>

<p class='c010'>"I can't help it if there is. You go on, and
hurry, too. It's almost school time."</p>

<p class='c010'>Reluctantly the little girl left the tree and
went on down the street and around the next
corner. Fortunately she took the dog with her.</p>

<p class='c010'>Carefully and warily Jazbury crept along a
gutter to the foot of the tree. "Hurry, Fluffy!"
he mewed. "Come down. We must get away
before the dog comes back."</p>

<p class='c010'>"Oh, I'm afraid!" wailed Fluffy. "I want to
go home. Mew! Mew!"</p>

<p class='c010'>"Don't stop to cry," called Jazbury impatiently.
"You can't get home now, and if you
don't hurry the dog will be back again."</p>

<p class='c010'>So urged, Fluffy managed to half scramble,
half fall down the tree, and he and Jazbury made
off down the street as fast as they could go.</p>

<p class='c010'>They had come almost to the end of the village
now, and Yowler was waiting for them.</p>

<p class='c010'>"What kept you so long?" he mewed crossly.
"I've been waiting and waiting for you."</p>

<p class='c010'>"A dog almost caught Fluffy," said Jazbury;
and he told Yowler the story of Fluffy's adventures.
"Wasn't that terrible?" asked Jazbury.</p>

<p class='c010'>"Oh, I don't know. He didn't get him, anyway,"
said Yowler impatiently. "We'll get to
the fields in a minute now, and then we can all
keep together. There won't be any one to see
us."</p>

<p class='c010'>A little later they were out of the village
altogether. Before them lay the sunny breadth
of the country, a meadow and a stream, a field,
and far away the dark edge of a shady wood.</p>

<p class='c010'>The kittens slipped through a fence and into
the deep grass of the meadow. Insects whined
about them. A butterfly fluttered by, so close
above them that when Jazbury leaped for it he
almost caught it. He would have liked to chase
some of the insects that flitted about, but Yowler
told him to wait. "There are plenty of other
things to catch," he said. "Bigger things that
we can really eat."</p>

<p class='c010'>"Isn't it fun, Fluffy?" cried Jazbury. "Aren't
you glad we came?"</p>

<p class='c010'>"Yes, it is fun," answered Fluffy; but he did
not seem quite as joyous over it as Jazbury.</p>

<p class='c010'>A little later Yowler crept away from them
through the grasses. They saw him pounce,
and a moment later he came back with a little
field-mouse in his mouth.</p>

<p class='c010'>"What did I tell you?" he purred, proudly.
"Guess we won't starve here. The fields are
full of them."</p>

<p class='c010'>They divided the field-mouse amongst them,
and though none of them were hungry it was
fun to eat out there in the open meadow with
the blue sky overhead, and the warm wind ruffling
their fur.</p>

<p class='c010'>They went on again presently, taking their
time, and making side excursions through the
grasses, or stopping to rest and sun themselves
in the more open places.</p>

<p class='c010'>Not until late afternoon did they come to the
wood. By that time they were hungry again.
Fluffy managed to catch a small bird, which delighted
the other two.</p>

<p class='c010'>"Isn't he a fine catcher? What did I tell
you?" boasted Jazbury.</p>

<p class='c010'>After they had eaten the bird Yowler told the
others to wait where they were, while he went on
to find a place for them to sleep.</p>

<p class='c010'>After he left them the two younger kittens
dropped into silence. Dusk was drawing
down. How big and dark and lonely it seemed
in the wood. Jazbury thought of his mother
and Aunt Tabby. They must have missed him
by now. How troubled they would be. There
would be good milk in the saucer in the pantry.
They must be eating their supper by now. But
maybe they would be too sad and sorry to eat.</p>

<p class='c010'>Fluffy snuggled up close against him. "Jazbury!"
he whispered.</p>

<p class='c010'>"Yes."</p>

<p class='c010'>"Don't you wish we were home?"</p>

<p class='c010'>"Well, I wouldn't mind it."</p>

<p class='c010'>"Let's go home. Let's go before Yowler gets
back."</p>

<p class='c010'>"No; that would be mean. But maybe tomorrow,--only
I don't know the way."</p>

<p class='c010'>"Miaw-aw-aw!" came Yowler's loud voice,
breaking harshly through the silence of the
wood. "Come on over here, kits; I've found a
fine place to sleep."</p>

<p class='c010'>The other kittens hurried toward the place
from which his voice had come, and found him
standing in front of a hollow tree. There was
a bed of moss and dry leaves in the hollow, and
it was snug and dry. The three kittens crept
into it and snuggled down together, and soon
they were fast asleep, worn out by their journey
and the adventures they had passed through.</p>

<div class='chapter'></div>
  <h2 class='c001'>VII</h2>
<p class='drop-capa0_3_0_6 c009'>Jazbury opened his eyes and looked
about him. For a moment he could not
think where he was. Instead of the
white-washed walls and beams of the cellar, the
sides of the tree arched up above him; and there
was Fluffy cuddled up close against him, instead
of Mother Bunch and Aunt Tabby.</p>

<p class='c010'>Then he remembered. He had run away.
He was in the wood. But where was Yowler?
He had been there when Jazbury went to sleep.
Surely Yowler had not gone away and deserted
them.</p>

<p class='c010'>"Fluffy!" he mewed.</p>

<p class='c010'>Without opening his eyes Fluffy gave a sleepy
little answering mew. He stretched himself
and yawned, showing his little pink tongue
curled up inside his mouth. Then he opened
his eyes.</p>

<p class='c010'>"Why, Jazbury!" he said in a surprised tone.
He looked about him in a startled way. "Why--why--I'd
forgotten we ran away. Where's
Yowler?"</p>

<p class='c010'>"I don't know. Let's call him."</p>

<p class='c010'>But at this moment Yowler came strolling
around from behind the tree. "Hello, kits!" he
said. He had a comfortable, lazy look. He
was licking his lips, and there was a tiny feather
sticking to one of his whiskers.</p>

<p class='c010'>"Where have you been?" asked Jazbury.</p>

<p class='c010'>"Oh, I just went out to look about."</p>

<p class='c010'>"Well, I'm hungry. What shall we do about
breakfast?"</p>

<p class='c010'>"Yes; what shall we do about breakfast?"
chimed in Fluffy.</p>

<p class='c010'>"Oh, you'll have to catch something. There's
plenty here in the woods."</p>

<p class='c010'>"But aren't you going to help us?" asked Jazbury
anxiously.</p>

<p class='c010'>"No. I don't feel hungry. You kits go
ahead. You won't have any trouble about it.
If I want anything I'll catch it later on."</p>

<p class='c010'>"But I don't know <i>how</i> to catch things. I
never learned," said Jazbury.</p>

<p class='c010'>"All the worse for you, but I can't help it,"
said Yowler cruelly.</p>

<p class='c010'>Fluffy had been looking sharply at Yowler.
Now he said, "Yowler, there's a feather on your
whiskers."</p>

<p class='c010'>Yowler started. "Oh, is there?" he said, and
he hastily wiped it off with his paw. "You'd
better hurry up if you want to catch anything."
He added. "I'm sleepy. Guess I'll take another
snooze."</p>

<p class='c010'>He went inside the tree and curled himself up
in the warm spot that Jazbury and Fluffy had
just left, and closed his eyes. The two smaller
kittens stood looking at him for a moment.</p>

<p class='c010'>"Come on, Jazbury!" mewed Fluffy. "Let's
go and look for something to eat."</p>

<p class='c010'>The two little kittens wandered away from the
tree and on deeper into the wood. Jazbury
felt very much hurt that Yowler would not come
with them. He didn't see why he wasn't hungry,
too.</p>

<p class='c010'>"I know why he wasn't hungry," said Fluffy
mysteriously.</p>

<p class='c010'>"Why?"</p>

<p class='c010'>"Oh, I'll tell you some time."</p>

<p class='c010'>"Why won't you tell me now?"</p>

<p class='c010'>"I don't want to; but I'll tell you some time."</p>

<p class='c010'>Jazbury looked about him. "I don't see
wherever we're to get anything to eat," he
mewed.</p>

<p class='c010'>"I do, right now," whispered Fluffy. "Hist!
Keep still now."</p>

<div id='il050'  class='figcenter id010'>
<img src='images/il050fp.jpg' alt='' class='ig010' />
<div class='ic010'>
<p><i>Fluffy dropped the bird and put his paw on it</i></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>He crept silently forward through the bushes,
there was a sudden leap--a squeak--a flutter,
and a moment later Fluffy came back proudly
carrying in his mouth a young bird he had
killed.</p>

<p class='c010'>"Oh, goody!" cried Jazbury, "I just love bird,
and I've never tasted it but once. Aunt Tabby
caught one in the yard at home and gave me a
piece. Won't Yowler be pleased? Come on!
Let's hurry back with it and all have breakfast."</p>

<p class='c010'>Fluffy dropped the bird and put his paw on it.
"I'm not going to give Yowler any," he declared.</p>

<p class='c010'>"Not give Yowler any! Oh, Fluffy! Why
not?"</p>

<p class='c010'>"Because. Now I'll tell you what I was
going to tell you awhile ago, and didn't. I'm
just sure Yowler caught a bird this morning and
ate it all himself before we were awake."</p>

<p class='c010'>Jazbury could hardly believe such a thing
could be true. "Oh, Fluffy! He wouldn't be
so mean!" he cried.</p>

<p class='c010'>"Well, I'm sure of it. Don't you remember
the feather on his whiskers? Anyway, you
might as well eat your share of the bird for I
shan't give Yowler even a single bone, whether
you eat any of it or not."</p>

<p class='c010'>So the two little friends sat there on the soft
moss and divided the bird between them. How
delicious it was! The kittens purred and
smacked their lips over it, it was so good, but
all the while Jazbury had an unhappy feeling
that they were treating Yowler very badly, for
he <i>couldn't</i> have done such a mean thing as to
catch a bird and eat it without telling them a
word about it.</p>

<p class='c010'>After they had finished eating Fluffy sat down
and began to wash himself. "You'd better wash
yourself, too, Jazbury," he said. "Just look
how dirty and dusty your fur is."</p>

<p class='c010'>"I don't care," mewed Jazbury. "I didn't
come out in the woods to wash myself, and I
don't mean to do it. I'm never, never, never
going to wash myself until we go home
again."</p>

<p class='c010'>"You'd feel a whole lot more comfortable if
you were nice and clean," said Fluffy, and he
went on washing himself until his fur fairly
shone with whiteness.</p>

<p class='c010'>Then the two kittens strolled back toward the
tree. Jazbury was almost ashamed to face
Yowler. Anyway, it was not his fault. It had
not been his bird.</p>

<p class='c010'>Suddenly Fluffy stopped, his eyes wide and
excited. "There, look at that!" he cried.</p>

<p class='c010'>"What?" asked Jazbury.</p>

<p class='c010'>"There! Under that bush!"</p>

<p class='c010'>Jazbury looked, and then he saw a little heap
of feathers lying under the bush,--a wing--a
tail. Fluffy went over to where they lay and
sniffed about. "I knew it," he mewed. "Yowler
has been here. This is where he killed the
bird and ate it. Now you'll believe me, I
guess."</p>

<p class='c010'>Jazbury, too, went over to the bush and sniffed
about, and he could very easily tell that Yowler
had been there. It made him feel very sad that
their companion should have played such a trick
upon them.</p>

<p class='c010'>When they came to the hollow tree they found
Yowler still fast asleep. Their coming awakened
him. "Did you catch anything?" he asked
eagerly.</p>

<p class='c010'>"Yes, we caught a bird."</p>

<p class='c010'>"Where is it?" Yowler sprang to his feet.
"Did you bring it home?"</p>

<p class='c010'>Jazbury and Fluffy looked at each other.
Then Fluffy said, "No; we ate it."</p>

<p class='c010'>"Ate it! Without giving me any? What
d'you mean by that? Ain't we pardners?
Here I bring you along with me, and show you
a good place to sleep, and you go and eat up all
the breakfast without giving me even a taste."</p>

<p class='c010'>"You didn't give us any of the bird you
caught," retorted Fluffy.</p>

<p class='c010'>"Bird I caught! What d'you mean? When
did I catch any bird?"</p>

<p class='c010'>"Before we were awake. And you ate it all
yourself, and never saved a bit for us."</p>

<p class='c010'>"I don't know what you mean; don't know
what you're talking about," blustered Yowler.
"But I'm not going to argue with you. If you
can catch things, so can I. And I can eat them
all myself, too, just as much as you can." And
he stalked away, and would not answer them
when they called after him.</p>

<p class='c010'>After that Yowler hunted by himself, and the
other kittens by themselves. At first Jazbury
found it very hard to catch anything. The birds
and mice all got away from him. He would
have had to go hungry or to content himself with
grasshoppers and beetles if it had not been for
Fluffy. But Fluffy was such a good little hunter
that he always managed to catch enough to eat,
and whatever he caught he always shared with
Jazbury. He was a better hunter than Yowler,
and after a while Yowler said maybe they'd all
better hunt together and share whatever they
might catch. "Only, of course, Jazbury ought
to let us have the best pieces," he added, "because
he's no good about catching things."</p>

<p class='c010'>"Yes, he is, too," mewed Fluffy indignantly.
"He's learning. And anyway, I'd rather share
with him than with you any day, and you can
hunt by yourself, and we'll hunt by ourselves.
That's the way you wanted us to do it at first, and
now that's the way we like best."</p>

<p class='c010'>This made Yowler very angry, and he would
not speak to Fluffy for a whole day.</p>

<p class='c010'>Jazbury, indeed, was becoming a very fine
hunter,--better, even, than Fluffy himself.
Fluffy was very skilful, but Jazbury was not
only quick, he was also strong and brave;
stronger and braver than the gentle little Fluffy
had ever dreamed of being.</p>

<p class='c010'>Fluffy admired Jazbury very much, and was
proud of the way he caught things. But one
thing troubled him. Jazbury <i>would not</i> wash
himself. Every day he grew dirtier and
rougher, until at last he looked more like some
wild creature of the wood than a little town kitten
who should have known enough to wash and
care for himself.</p>
<div class='chapter'></div>
  <h2 class='c001'>VIII</h2>
<p class='drop-capa0_3_0_6 c009'>For some time the weather was beautiful,
clear and warm and sunny. But
after about a week it changed. Clouds
gathered. There was a feeling of rain in the
air, and the wind was chilly. The kittens huddled
close together at night for warmth. Yowler
always took the warmest corner, the one
furthest back in the tree where the leaves were
thickest and softest.</p>

<p class='c010'>In the daytime he went off on long prowls.
Sometimes the other kittens did not see him from
the time he set out in the morning till he came
back at night. They no longer liked or trusted
him, but it troubled them that he should stay
away so much. One day Jazbury asked him
whether he wouldn't show them the way home.
They were tired of staying in the woods, and he
wanted to see his dear mother and his Aunt
Tabby again. When Jazbury said this he felt
so sad that he began to mew pitifully. Fluffy
joined in, and the two little kittens cried bitterly.
"Let's go home!" they cried. "Oh, let's go
home. We don't want to stay here any longer."</p>

<p class='c010'>"Hush!" cried Yowler angrily. "Oh, <i>hush</i>!
I tell you I'm not going home. Not for a long
time, anyway. You may go if you like, but I
shan't."</p>

<p class='c010'>"But we don't know the way! We don't
know the wa-y-y-y!" wailed the kittens.</p>

<p class='c010'>"Well, I can't help that," retorted Yowler,
and he stalked away and left them still crying.</p>

<p class='c010'>It was the very next night that a rain set in.
Yowler had come home late. Jazbury and
Fluffy had already cuddled down together in
the tree, as far back as they could, for the night
was chilly and damp. But as soon as Yowler
came he crowded them out of their snug nest
and took it himself.</p>

<p class='c010'>"Oh, Yowler! We just got that place warm!"
mewed Fluffy.</p>

<p class='c010'>"I don't care! You can get another place
warm. This is where I am going to sleep."</p>

<p class='c010'>"I don't think that's fair!" said Jazbury. But
Yowler paid no attention to him. He curled
down and soon was fast asleep.</p>

<p class='c010'>It was not long after this that the rain began.
It beat into the tree. "Oh, dear!" said Jazbury.
"I'm getting so wet."</p>

<p class='c010'>"Listen, Jazbury," whispered Fluffy. "Yowler
has the only dry place here. Do you remember
that sort of little cave I found today under
that big rock? It isn't far away, and I'm sure
we could keep dry there. It isn't very big. Not
big enough for all of us to sleep in, but there
would be plenty of room for you and me."</p>

<p class='c010'>"All right," said Jazbury. "One thing's
sure, we'll soon be dripping wet if we stay here."</p>

<p class='c010'>The two little friends crept out of the hollow
without wakening Yowler, and ran quickly over
to the cave Fluffy had spoken of. It was indeed
a cosy little cave and perfectly dry, really much
better than the hollow of the tree. The two little
kittens crept in and huddled down together.</p>

<p class='c010'>Outside the rain beat. The leaves hung down
from the trees, drenched and heavy with water;
the ground was sodden, but the two little kittens
cared nothing for all this.</p>

<p class='c010'>All night they slept there as dry and comfortable
as though they had been in their cellar at
home instead of out in the wild wood with only
a rock cave to shelter them.</p>

<p class='c010'>The next morning Fluffy and Jazbury were
awakened by a loud "Miaw-aw-aw! Miaw-aw-aw!"
It was Yowler calling them.</p>

<p class='c010'>"That's Yowler," said Fluffy. "He must
have awakened."</p>

<p class='c010'>Jazbury rose and stretched himself and
stepped outside the cave. It had stopped raining;
the sun was shining down through the
leaves, but the woods were still wet.</p>

<p class='c010'>"Here we are, Yowler," he called.</p>

<p class='c010'>Yowler came over toward the cave. He was
dripping wet.</p>

<p class='c010'>"Where have you been all night?" he asked
crossly. "What did you mean by going off
without telling me? Look how wet I am! A
mean trick, I call it."</p>

<p class='c010'>"Well, Yowler, we thought you were dry,"
said Jazbury. "You took the only dry place
there was, so we came over here."</p>

<p class='c010'>"Dry place! I look as if I'd been in a dry
place, don't I? I just guess not. Sopping wet
I am."</p>

<div id='il062'  class='figcenter id011'>
<img src='images/il062fp.jpg' alt='' class='ig011' />
<div class='ic011'>
<p><i>He turned on them so fiercely that they were frightened</i></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>"Well, Yowler, we didn't know it," said
Fluffy.</p>

<p class='c010'>"Oh, be quiet. I don't care, anyway. I'm
tired of the woods. I know a farmhouse near
here where they want another cat, and I'm going
there to live. I met a cat that lives there, and he
asked me to come."</p>

<p class='c010'>"Oh, but Yowler! What's going to become
of us? Can we come, too?" cried Jazbury.</p>

<p class='c010'>"No, you can't. They only want one cat. If
you tried to tag along they'd drive us all away."</p>

<p class='c010'>"But won't you show us the way home first?"
begged Fluffy. "Please, please do. We're
tired of the woods, too, but we don't know where
else to go."</p>

<p class='c010'>"Well, you find some place," said Yowler.
"I did, so you can, too, if you try hard enough."
With that he turned tail and stalked away
through the wood.</p>

<p class='c010'>Jazbury and Fluffy followed him, mewing,
until he turned on them so fiercely that they
were frightened. Then they stopped and stood
looking after him until he disappeared in the
wood, and never once did he look back, or say
one word of good-bye to them.</p>
<div class='chapter'></div>
  <h2 class='c001'>IX</h2>
<p class='drop-capa0_1_0_6 c009'>"There! He's gone away mad," mewed
Fluffy. "Now what shall we do?"</p>

<p class='c010'>"Do! Why just what we have been
doing," said Jazbury. "He wasn't any good to
us, anyway."</p>

<p class='c010'>"Yes, but I want to go home. Oh, I <i>do</i> want
to go home; and we don't know the way."</p>

<p class='c010'>"Why don't we? Guess I could find it just
as well as Yowler."</p>

<p class='c010'>"Oh, could you? Could you, Jazbury?"</p>

<p class='c010'>"Listen, Fluffy!" said Jazbury. "There was
something mother told me, and I'd forgotten all
about it. I just remembered a little while ago.
She said cats--and kittens, too, if they weren't
too little--could always get home from any place
if they just didn't worry about it and try to remember
the way to go. All they have to do is
to love their home, and run along without thinking,
and then they'll get there."</p>

<p class='c010'>"I don't know what you mean," said Fluffy,
"but let's go anyway. Even if we don't get
home we can't be any more lost than we are
now."</p>

<p class='c010'>"But we <i>will</i> get there," declared Jazbury.
"Come on! We might as well go right now."</p>

<p class='c010'>"All right; I'm ready."</p>

<p class='c010'>The two little kittens set out at once, and without
any more talk about it. They trotted away
through the green depths of the wood, and after
a while the trees grew thinner, and then they
came out of the wood upon a hot, sunny stretch
of dusty road.</p>

<p class='c010'>"We go this way," said Jazbury, and he set off
down the road just as if he knew exactly where
he was going.</p>

<p class='c010'>"Are you sure this is the right way?" asked
Fluffy.</p>

<p class='c010'>"Now, Fluffy, you mustn't ask me that," said
Jazbury. "I mustn't think about it, but just run
along, and we'll get there. Don't you be
afraid."</p>

<p class='c010'>Fluffy said no more, but padded along after
Jazbury. Jazbury never stopped or looked
around. He just went running straight on
down the dusty road.</p>

<p class='c010'>After they had gone for quite a distance
Fluffy heard a noise behind them, a thudding
sound, and with it a sound of rumbling and rolling.
He looked around, and there behind them
came a great, enormous horse and a buggy, with
two ladies driving in it.</p>

<p class='c010'>"Jazbury," he mewed softly, "there's something
coming."</p>

<p class='c010'>Jazbury stopped and looked round. Then he
ran over to the side of the road, and crouched
down. "Come over here till they get past,
Fluffy," he said.</p>

<p class='c010'>Fluffy trotted over and crouched down beside
him.</p>

<p class='c010'>Nearer and nearer came the horse and buggy,
the horse thudding along and the buggy rumbling
after it.</p>

<p class='c010'>Just as the buggy came to where the kittens
were one of the ladies cried out, "Oh, Sarah!
Look there! Look at those kittens."</p>

<p class='c010'>The buggy stopped, and the two ladies leaned
forward, staring at Jazbury and Fluffy.</p>

<p class='c010'>"How do you suppose they ever got here?"
asked the lady.</p>

<p class='c010'>"I don't know," answered her companion.
"I suppose some one wanted to get rid of them
and dropped them here."</p>

<p class='c010'>"Isn't that wicked! What shall we do about
it?"</p>

<div id='il068'  class='figcenter id012'>
<img src='images/il068fp.jpg' alt='' class='ig012' />
<div class='ic012'>
<p><i>They were almost hidden by the dusty weeds</i></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>The talking went on. The kittens could hear
the voices, one soft and gentle, the other quick
and decided.</p>

<p class='c010'>"Let's get down among the weeds, Fluffy,"
whispered Jazbury. "Then we can creep
away."</p>

<p class='c010'>The kittens ran, crouching, down into a dry
gutter beside the road. There they were almost
hidden by the dusty weeds.</p>

<p class='c010'>"Oh, Sarah! They're running away!" cried
the soft-voiced lady.</p>

<p class='c010'>"I'll catch them!" said the other. She hastily
clambered down from the buggy, and ran over
to the side of the road and parted the weeds.
When the kittens looked up they could see her
big face above them looking down at them.
Then her hands came down through the weeds,
and caught them by the napes of their necks.
One hand caught Jazbury and the other hand
caught Fluffy. The hands lifted them out of
the weeds and up into the air.</p>

<p class='c010'>The kittens were very much frightened.
Fluffy hung quietly, with his legs and tail curled
up, and his head on one side, but Jazbury fought
and struggled, and tried to scratch the hand that
held him.</p>

<p class='c010'>"Did you ever see such a little wildcat?" the
lady called to her friend, as she carried the kittens
back to the buggy.</p>

<p class='c010'>"Here! Let's put them in a bag!" cried the
other lady.</p>

<p class='c010'>She dived down under the seat of the buggy
and got out a big brown bag, and held it out with
the mouth open ready for the kittens to be
dropped into it.</p>

<p class='c010'>A moment later and Fluffy and Jazbury found
themselves in the bag, with the mouth of it tied
tight, so that they could not possibly get out.
The bag, with them in it, was laid in the back
part of the buggy, and then the rumbling
and thudding began again as the buggy drove
on. The kittens were jolted and shaken about.</p>

<p class='c010'>"Oh, Jazbury!" mewed Fluffy. "What do
you s'pose they're going to do with us?"</p>

<p class='c010'>"I don't know. We'll have to try to get out."</p>

<p class='c010'>Jazbury began to tear and bite at the loose
threads of the bag, but he could not make even
the least little hole in the bagging. After awhile
he gave it up and began to mew loudly.</p>

<p class='c010'>"Mew! Me-ew-ew-ew!" he cried.</p>

<p class='c010'>"Mew-ew! Me-ew-ew-ew! Mew-ew-ew!"
cried Fluffy.</p>

<p class='c010'>The buggy rumbled and jolted. The kittens
mewed and mewed. Now and then they
stopped and listened. Then they could hear the
voices talking up above them. Then they
would mew again louder than ever.</p>

<p class='c010'>After a while the buggy stopped, and the bag
with the kittens in it was lifted out and carried
into the house. The bag was opened again, and
the two big faces looked in on them.</p>

<p class='c010'>"Did you ever see anything as dirty as the
black one?" said the lady who caught them. "I
hated to touch him. I know one thing; if I'm
going to keep him, the first thing I'm going to
do is to give him a good scrubbing with tar
soap."</p>

<p class='c010'>"Oh, Sarah!" cried the other. "You oughtn't
to wash cats. You'll make him sick. Get the
white one out for me, won't you? I'm afraid to
put my hand in. I'm afraid the black one will
scratch me."</p>

<p class='c010'>Miss Sarah put her hand down in the bag, and
lifted Fluffy out and gave him to her companion.</p>

<p class='c010'>"Isn't he too sweet?" cried that lady. "He
doesn't look a bit dirty, either. I'm going to
take him right over home and give him something
to eat. I expect he's hungry."</p>

<p class='c010'>After she had gone, Miss Sarah closed the bag
and carried it a while and dumped it down again.
Jazbury heard her call, "Bring me a basin of
water out in the shed, Hannah, and that tar soap
from up in the bathroom closet."</p>

<div id='il072'  class='figcenter id013'>
<img src='images/il072fp.jpg' alt='' class='ig013' />
<div class='ic013'>
<p><i>He spit and mewed and fought, but she held him there</i></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Jazbury did not know what the words meant,
but they frightened him.</p>

<p class='c010'>A little later the bag was untied again and
turned upside down, and Jazbury was shaken
out of it. Trembling and frightened, he looked
about him. He was in a shed. Miss Sarah was
there, and another woman with a checked apron
on.</p>

<p class='c010'>"Poor little thing! He looks scared to
death," said the woman with the checked apron.</p>

<p class='c010'>"I know," said Miss Sarah. "I just hate to
wash him, but I can't take him into the house
till he's clean."</p>

<p class='c010'>Then a terrible thing happened to Jazbury.
Miss Sarah stooped and picked him up, and before
he could catch his breath she had put him in
a basin of water. He spit and mewed and
fought, but she held him there. She splashed
water over him, and she rubbed him with soap.
She rubbed the soapsuds in around his ears, and
over his forehead, and even down his little black
nose. She soaped his legs and his body and his
tail. Then she washed the soapsuds off. Last
of all, she wrapped him in a towel and rubbed
and rubbed and rubbed him.</p>

<p class='c010'>By that time Jazbury was too miserable to
fight. He only shivered and shook and mewed
pitifully now and then.</p>

<p class='c010'>"There!" said Miss Sarah at last. "That's
about as dry as I can get you. You poor little
thing! You shall have a good meal to comfort
you."</p>

<p class='c010'>She carried Jazbury into the house, and his
fur was so clean that it fairly shone and glistened
like black satin. "You're a real beauty," said
Miss Sarah, "and I never would have guessed it
when I picked you up in the road."</p>

<p class='c010'>That's the way Jazbury began life in his new
home. It was a very pleasant home except for
one thing; Miss Sarah would wash him every
now and then.</p>

<p class='c010'>He had plenty to eat and drink. There were
soft chairs and sunny spots to sleep in, and as
soon as he was used to the place, and Miss Sarah
thought he would not run away, he was allowed
to go out of doors whenever he wanted to.</p>

<p class='c010'>The first day he was allowed to go out he
found there was a flower garden in front of
the house. It was a fine place to play. Paths
wound about among the flower beds. Bees
buzzed busily from bloom to bloom, and bright
butterflies floated about overhead.</p>

<p class='c010'>Jazbury examined it all over. There was a
paling fence between it and the garden next
door. When Jazbury came near this fence he
saw a little furry white face peering through at
him between the palings. It was Fluffy.</p>

<p class='c010'>"Oh, Jazbury!" he called joyfully. "I was
watching for you. I hoped you'd come out
soon."</p>

<p class='c010'>"Why! did you know I lived here?"</p>

<p class='c010'>"Yes. The lady that carried me away that
day just took me in next door. I knew our
yards were next to each other."</p>

<p class='c010'>"Come on over," said Jazbury.</p>

<p class='c010'>Fluffy squeezed through between the palings,
and the two little kittens greeted each other joyfully.
They rubbed noses and purred and
purred. After that they began to play. They
ran races along the paths, and tried to catch the
butterflies, and had a fine time together.</p>

<p class='c010'>At lunch time Fluffy had to go home, but he
and Jazbury agreed to meet out in the garden
every single day, unless it rained, and play together
just as they used to do. It made Jazbury
very happy to know he was to have his little
friend living so near him.</p>

<div class='chapter'></div>
  <h2 class='c001'>X</h2>
<p class='drop-capa0_3_0_6 c009'>It was a warm, sunny day in June.</p>

<p class='c010'>The two little kittens had met as they often
did, under a large blush rosebush in the
garden. Jazbury did not seem as lively and
playful as usual.</p>

<p class='c010'>"What's the matter with you, Jazbury?" asked
Fluffy. "You seem so quiet. Don't you want
to play?"</p>

<p class='c010'>"No."</p>

<p class='c010'>"Why?"</p>

<p class='c010'>Jazbury was silent for a moment. Then he
said, "I've just had a bath again."</p>

<p class='c010'>"Oh, Jazbury! Not again?"</p>

<p class='c010'>"Yes, again. With water. And soap. And
rubbed afterward. You know. I told you all
about it."</p>

<p class='c010'>"But, Jazbury!" cried Fluffy. "What does
she do it for? Of course you <i>were</i> dirty at first.
You know you were. You really needed to be
washed then. I don't believe you could have
cleaned yourself, you were so <i>very</i> dirty. But
you don't need to be bathed now."</p>

<p class='c010'>"Course I don't. I wash and wash myself.
I wash every day. I wash myself just as much
as you do. And I'm not going to stand being
<i>scrubbed</i> with water. No, I'm not."</p>

<p class='c010'>"But what are you going to do about it?"</p>

<p class='c010'>"I'll tell you what I'm going to do. I'm going
to run away. <i>I'm going home!</i>"</p>

<p class='c010'>Fluffy started.</p>

<p class='c010'>"Oh, Jazbury! You're not--not <i>really</i> going
home? Where our mommas live?"</p>

<p class='c010'>"Yes, I am. I'm going away tonight before
she has a chance to wash me again."</p>

<p class='c010'>"Oh, goody! goody!" cried Fluffy. "And
I'll go, too. May I, Jazbury? I want to."</p>

<p class='c010'>"All right. You meet me out here tonight
when it's too dark for any one to see us. I'll be
waiting for you."</p>

<p class='c010'>The two little kittens were so excited over this
plan that Jazbury grew quite cheerful again.
How wonderful it would be to see their mothers
again, and to play in their own back yards.
They felt as though they could hardly wait to
set out on their homeward journey.</p>
<div class='chapter'></div>
  <h2 class='c001'>XI</h2>
<p class='drop-capa0_3_0_6 c009'>It was dark; the stars were in the sky, and
the fireflies were flickering among the
flowers of the garden when Jazbury and
Fluffy met under the rosebush again.</p>

<p class='c010'>"Are you there, Jazbury?" mewed Fluffy.</p>

<p class='c010'>"Yes; waiting for you. Come on!"</p>

<p class='c010'>The two little kittens stole down the garden
path to the gate, and out into the road beyond.</p>

<p class='c010'>"Are you sure you can find the way, Jazbury?"
asked Fluffy.</p>

<p class='c010'>"Now, Fluffy, you mustn't begin asking me
that," said Jazbury. "If I begin thinking, we'll
get lost. We've just got to go along the way I
<i>feel</i> like going, and then we'll get there."</p>

<p class='c010'>The kittens were silent after that. They
trotted along steadily through the starlit night.
They had no trouble about keeping to the road,
for kittens can see just about as well in the dark
as in the light.</p>

<p class='c010'>They came to the place where the ladies had
found them that day that now seemed so long
ago. After a while they passed a big white gate,
and a long lane leading up toward a barn.
There was a farm-house on beyond the barn.
They heard a dog barking there.</p>

<p class='c010'>"Oh, Jazbury! I hope that dog won't come
and catch us," whispered Fluffy.</p>

<p class='c010'>"Course he won't. He's too far away to see
us."</p>

<p class='c010'>The next moment the kittens stopped short,
their little hearts leaping with terror. Something
was moving stealthily among the weeds
at the roadside. A dead twig cracked. There
was a sound of breathing, and a gleam of big
yellow eyes.</p>

<p class='c010'>"What's that, Jazbury?" whispered Fluffy.</p>

<p class='c010'>"Hus-s-sh! I don't know!"</p>

<p class='c010'>There was a silence. "Jazbury, I'm scared.
Let's get away," whispered Fluffy again.</p>

<p class='c010'>"Hush, I tell you!"</p>

<p class='c010'>The thing, whatever it was, was coming out
from the weeds. Jazbury's tail grew big. His
fur stood on end. The next moment a well-known
yowl broke the stillness.</p>

<p class='c010'>"Yowler!" cried Jazbury.</p>

<p class='c010'>"Yeh! Yowler," answered that kitten, as he
gave a leap out from among the weeds. "Hello,
kits! I didn't know who you were until I heard
you whispering together. Where are you
bound for?"</p>

<p class='c010'>"We're going home," said Jazbury. He was
not at all glad to meet with Yowler again.</p>

<p class='c010'>"Going home, are you! Well, now, that's not
half bad. If you like, maybe I'll go along with
you."</p>

<p class='c010'>"But I thought you wanted to live on a farm,"
said Fluffy.</p>

<p class='c010'>"Well, so I did, and I've been living there, but
I don't have to stay in one place all the time."</p>

<p class='c010'>"Don't you like it there?" asked Jazbury.</p>

<p class='c010'>"Sure I did. Like it fine. Sure had a grand
time. But I guess maybe the baker's looking
for me, and I might as well go home. One
place's just as good as another for me."</p>

<p class='c010'>Neither Jazbury nor Fluffy wanted Yowler
with them again, but they did not know how to
tell him that.</p>

<p class='c010'>"Well, let's go on," said Jazbury. "No use
staying here all night."</p>

<p class='c010'>As the three kittens trotted along through the
starry darkness Yowler began to ask the kittens
about where they had been living, how they had
been treated, and what they had to eat.</p>

<p class='c010'>"Had pretty good times, didn't you?" he said
at last.</p>

<p class='c010'>"Yes; but we like our own homes best!"
mewed Jazbury.</p>

<p class='c010'>Yowler was silent for a while. Then suddenly
he burst out, "Tell you what! I said I
liked it fine at the farm, but I didn't. They
treated me mean. Never got a thing to eat but
mice and rats, and had to catch everything for
myself. They kept me in the barn, too, and if
I even so much as poked my nose outside it the
dog was after me. Wow! If I'd had a home
like you two, catch me leaving it! But some
kits have all the luck."</p>

<p class='c010'>Fluffy and Jazbury felt quite sorry for Yowler.
He must indeed have had a very hard time.
But then, as Fluffy said to Jazbury later on, if
he hadn't been so mean to them and run away
and left them, he might have found a good home,
too, just as they had, and have stayed there if he
had chosen to.</p>
<div class='chapter'></div>
  <h2 class='c001'>XII</h2>
<p class='drop-capa0_4_0_6 c009'>Mother Bunch and Aunt Tabby
were sitting on the kitchen steps,
feeling very sad.</p>

<p class='c010'>It was a long time since little Jazbury had run
away and left them, but they could not get used
to being without him. Bitterly did they miss his
fun and his liveliness and all his pretty ways.</p>

<p class='c010'>"The quickest, strongest, handsomest kitten I
ever had," said Mother Bunch.</p>

<p class='c010'>"If I only hadn't boxed his ears that time,"
mourned Aunt Tabby, "maybe he wouldn't have
run away."</p>

<p class='c010'>"You mustn't let yourself think that," mewed
Mother Bunch. "I guess we were both of us a
little hard on him."</p>

<p class='c010'>Suddenly there was a sound of scratching and
scrabbling on the fence between the yard and
the lot.</p>

<p class='c010'>"Oh, if that were only little Jazbury," mewed
Aunt Tabby sadly.</p>

<p class='c010'>"Don't say that; you know it couldn't be,"
said Mother Bunch.</p>

<p class='c010'>A moment later both cats sprang to their feet
with a loud mew.</p>

<p class='c010'>Above the top of the fence appeared a little
black and white face, two white paws, a black
body, a black tail waving like a flag. It was
Jazbury.</p>

<p class='c010'>He jumped down into the yard, and rushed
up to his mother and Aunt Tabby. Fluffy followed
him.</p>

<p class='c010'>"Momma! momma!" he mewed. "Oh, Aunt
Tabby! I'll never run away again. Oh, I'm so
glad to be home!"</p>

<p class='c010'>He and his mother and Aunt Tabby rubbed
noses, and the cats kissed Jazbury, cat fashion,
and mewed aloud with joy.</p>

<p class='c010'>"And little Fluffy, too!" cried Mother Bunch.
"Oh, how glad your mother will be to have you
home again. She's so unhappy about you."</p>

<p class='c010'>None of them noticed, at first, that Yowler
had followed the other two kittens into the yard,
and was now sitting over near the fence grinning
at them.</p>

<p class='c010'>"It was very, very naughty of you to run away,
Jazbury," said his aunt. "We've been worried
to death about you."</p>

<p class='c010'>"I know," mewed Jazbury, "and I'm so sorry.
But I'll never do it again, Aunt Tabby. Indeed
I won't."</p>

<p class='c010'>"I suppose you ought to be punished," sighed
his mother, "but I'm so glad to have you back
again I haven't the heart to do it."</p>

<p class='c010'>At that moment Aunt Tabby espied Yowler
sitting there grinning at them.</p>

<p class='c010'>"Did you go away with that Yowler cat?" she
cried. "Did you, Jazbury? Tell me at once."</p>

<p class='c010'>"Well, yes, I did."</p>

<p class='c010'>"I knew it! It's all his fault. S-s-st!
Gr-r-r-r! Get out of here, you bad cat!" And
Aunt Tabby flew at Yowler so fiercely that he
gave a wild miaw, and flew over the fence and
disappeared from sight.</p>

<p class='c010'>"And don't you ever dare to come back
again," Aunt Tabby growled after him.</p>

<p class='c010'>And Yowler never did. Maybe he went back
to the baker's, and maybe he left the neighborhood
in search of a better home, but at any rate
Jazbury never saw him again.</p>

<p class='c010'>And now Jazbury and the two cats settled
down on the kitchen steps together, and Jazbury
told his mother and Aunt Tabby all his adventures
ever since that early morning when he had
stolen away from home.</p>

<p class='c010'>Little Fluffy had already climbed over into his
own yard in search of his mother, so there were
only the three of them.</p>

<p class='c010'>The two older cats listened eagerly to Jazbury's
tale. "And I'll tell you one thing, Aunt
Tabby," mewed Jazbury as he ended his story,
"I learned to keep myself clean while I was at
Miss Sarah's. You needn't ever bother over
that again."</p>

<p class='c010'>"Well, that's a good thing," replied his aunt.
"Almost worth running away for, I should
say."</p>

<p class='c010'>"I don't know about that," sighed his mother.
"I don't know whether even that was worth all
the unhappiness he gave us."</p>

<p class='c010'>And Jazbury felt very sad at the thought of all
the trouble he had caused.</p>

<p class='c010'>That night the kitten slept in his own cellar
again, with his dear mother and Aunt Tabby,
one on either side of him. How safe and warm
and happy and sheltered he felt.</p>

<p class='c010'>When his mother and Aunt Tabby awoke the
next morning, however, Jazbury was no longer
there.</p>

<p class='c010'>"What <i>has</i> become of him?" mewed Aunt
Tabby. "He surely can't have run away
again."</p>

<p class='c010'>"Oh, no! Never think such a thing," cried
his mother. "He has just gone on upstairs.
Let's go and find him."</p>

<p class='c010'>The two cats hurried up the cellar steps together.
They found the door at the top already
open. As they entered the kitchen they saw
Jazbury dragging something in from the shed
beyond. Something that was too heavy for him
to lift.</p>

<div id='il090'  class='figcenter id014'>
<img src='images/il090fp.jpg' alt='' class='ig014' />
<div class='ic014'>
<p><i>They saw Jazbury dragging something in from the shed beyond</i></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>"Jazbury, what <i>have</i> you got there?" cried his
mother.</p>

<p class='c010'>Jazbury dropped the thing and ran over to
her. "It's the rat," he said.</p>

<p class='c010'>"The rat!" cried Aunt Tabby. "Not the rat
that lived in the shed, and that I've been trying
to catch for such a long time!"</p>

<p class='c010'>"Yes, that's the one," mewed Jazbury.</p>

<p class='c010'>The cats could hardly believe him. They
ran over and examined the rat all over, sniffing
at it.</p>

<p class='c010'>"But how ever did you manage to do it?"
cried Aunt Tabby. "Why, the creature's almost
as big as you are."</p>

<p class='c010'>"Well, you see, I <i>had</i> to learn to catch big
things in the wood," mewed Jazbury. "The rat
didn't know that; he thought he could frighten
me the way he had done before. So when I
went out to the shed early--before you were
awake--he came out to catch me; but I caught
him, instead."</p>

<p class='c010'>Then how his mother and Aunt Tabby praised
and petted him! Not another kitten in the
neighbourhood, not even Fluffy himself, could
have done such a thing as that.</p>

<p class='c010'>But Jazbury was not spoiled by their praises.
"Any cat could have done it," he said, "if they
could only have caught it. It was only because
he thought he could frighten me that I had a
chance to get him."</p>

<p class='c010'>But from that time on Jazbury became famous
as a mouser, and he kept himself so clean that
when he grew up he was one of the handsomest
cats in all the neighbourhood around.</p>
